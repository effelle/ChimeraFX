Unlike standard platforms that provide a broad but generic compatibility layer, <code>cfx_light</code> is specifically optimized for visual excellence and stability on the ESP32:</p> <ul> <li>Universal RMT Backend: Whether you use the ESP-IDF or Arduino framework in ESPHome, this component leverages the native ESP32 RMT (Remote Control) peripheral directly via the IDF drivers. This ensures fire-and-forget DMA transmissions regardless of your framework choice.</li> <li>Curated Timing Engine: Because we use a custom timing generator to ensure 1:1 color accuracy and zero-flicker performance, we support a curated list of the most popular 1-wire NRZ chipsets. We do not support the broad and often unstable list of older or 2-wire chipsets found in generic platforms.</li> </ul> <p>If your chipset is not on the supported list but uses standard 800Kbps timings, <code>WS2812X</code> is often a compatible drop-in choice.</p>"}]}
