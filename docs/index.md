# Welcome to ChimeraFX Docs

**ChimeraFX** is a native C++ custom component for ESPHome that brings the beauty of some of the best WLED effects to your Home Assistant setup, without the complexity.

It allows you to run complex RGB LED effects with high performance on ESP32 devices, completely avoiding the overhead and "spaghetti code" of old YAML lambda implementations.

## Key Features

*   **Native Performance**: Optimized for ESP-IDF and dual-core ESP32s.
*   **Zero-Lambda Config**: Uses a clean `external_components` setup.
*   **Rich Effect Library**: Ports of complex effects that were previously impossible or slow in pure YAML using `addressable_lambda`.
*   **Custom Palettes**: A curated selection of palettes to choose from.
*   **Intro Effects**: Run a special effect when the light turns on.
*   **Presets**: Create your own effect configurations.
*   **Timers**: Run an effect for a specific amount of time.
*   **Full Control**: Support for Speed, Intensity, Palettes, timers and Mirroring in real time or through presets.
